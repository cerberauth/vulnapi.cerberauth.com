# API Security Headers

Content Security Policy (CSP) security headers are essential for API security because they provide an added layer of protection against some vulnerabilities including cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks and data exfiltration. These headers are implemented on the web server to instruct the browser on which sources of content, such as scripts and resources, are considered safe and allowed to execute.
